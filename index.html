            <h1>Vsion</h1>
            <p>To become one of the ten top leading centers of excellence in gifted education and training. Educate gifted students, who in the future would be top scientists and engineers and work in the field of research for development in industrialization
                effort of the nation. entoring is a collaborative at-will relationship in which one person—a mentor—shares their knowledge, skills, and experience with another person, a mentee, who is typically not as knowledgeable or experienced and
                benefits from the mentor’s guidance and perspective. Mentoring is considered a highly effective talent development measure that can yield especially positive results in gifted students. Through this support, mentees can gain knowledge
                in their field of interest, learn specific skills, and receive valuable advice on their career plans and advancement.</p>
            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>Organize and run a highly efficient Science Shared Campus that can deliver high quality science and Mathematics (computational) education to gifted and talented high school students. Building on these principles, Science Shared Campus connects
                outstanding STEMM students as mentees with renowned STEMM experts as mentors. The mentees will have the opportunity to consult regularly with their mentors through the program’s online platform, which enables messaging, exchanging files,
                videoconferencing, and collaborating on projects with participants from all over the world. Mentors support their mentees for several years and each mentee and mentor will have the chance to evaluate each other regularly. </p>
